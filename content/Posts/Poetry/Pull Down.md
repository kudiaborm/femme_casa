Pull down
Nothing
Pull down
Nothing
Pull down
Fuck
Pull down
I feel it
Pull down
It's creeping back
Pull down
Who am I
Pull down
I'm afraid
Pull down
I'm alone
Pull down
None of this
Pull down
Is fulfilling
Pull down
I'm living a lie
Pull down
I can't seem to grasp it
Pull down
I already have it
Pull down
I think the same thought
Pull down
Over and over 
Pull down
And over and over
Pull down
And over again
Pull down
Am I real
Pull down
Am I Ill
Pull down
Mental illness
Pull down
Felt different
Pull down
Fixation
Pull down
Felt different
Pull down
Prior 
Pull down
I felt ill
Pull down
Now
Pull down
I feel fulfilled
Pull down
Euphoria
Pull down
Was mania
Pull down
Was obsession
Pull down
Was addiction
Pull down
Now
Pull down
I'm more me
Pull down
So am I me
Pull down
Oh look
