I'm kind of having a small panic attack. might be hard to relate but idk...
I'm really lonely and I have a lot of vague undevelopped desires for friendship/dating with specific people
I do this thing where I like want to really make a friend but also really date someone but tell myself not really but then it's never about the person it'ss about the image of the person I have in my head
not having a big support circle I tend to get this idea that they will fill all my relational needs
but one person can't
so it's a matter of forming a decent sized support circle but having nothing to go on because I don't know what's normal
my brain and my heart are on fire
