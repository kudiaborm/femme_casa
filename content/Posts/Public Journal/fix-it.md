I don't even know what my goal is. I'm in two different worlds and it hurts so much. "Please help us to accept ourselves, please help us to see who You created us to be". I don't even understand this. What hurts more is trying to live a certain way and not express what is deep in me. What is there to accept. Who is there to accept. It can't be as simple as just acceptance. Just do it and move on. Fuck therapy can't go fast enough.
