I'm supposed to seek wholeness but I don't feel less than whole. My identity is distorted but I don't feel disoriented. I hope therapy can warm me up to change or help me accept what I'm running away from, that this hasn't been a lifelong thing, although it has been a lifelong impulse.

I also don't know how much I was hurt or harmed by my last relationship. I also don't know how much I genuinely learned.

I also don't know what I want to get out of the whole thing.
