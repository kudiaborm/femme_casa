## Cogito Ergo Femme

A poor translation of: I think there I Femme.

I think about gender way too much. In this facet of my life in which Mastodon resides, it is a large part.

I like tech but am not that familiar with a lot of more advanced things, I'm working towards expanding my knowledge. A private instance was a step in that direction. I'm from a lot of places, mostly the internet. And I crave attention.

I'm also Catholic. Who knew!?
