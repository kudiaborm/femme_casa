I think. Like a lot. I think about thinking. I think about thinking about thinking. I feel. I feel about thinking, and think about feeling. Hell, I feel about feeling. My mind is cyclical and my personality is a contrasty mix of easy going and energetic.

I'm open. But, if you know me in real life, you probably know nothing on this site. So this site is an attempt to change that.

I'm Catholic. I'm trans. I like people. I like tech. I'm Black. I'm Hispanic. I love my natural hair. Those are the same thing. 

I'm femme! Â¡Bienvenidos a mi casa!
