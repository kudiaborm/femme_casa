## On Femeninity

Well I feel less pressure yeah. I feel like I can breathe and just focus on being my best me.

I know that femininity isn't defined by any bounds. Anyone who sees the world can see there is sexual dimorphism. Along with that are (what are potentially genetic) characteristics and traits. I’ve thought about being a “feminine man” in the past. Maybe part of me feels like I have to transition to get what I want. I don’t know if being a woman means: looking in the mirror and seeing a stereotype and shape, melting in with other women and being trusted, being a caregiver, being the receptive/receiving person in romantic relationships, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. But I feel like wanting a woman’s job and wanting everything a woman has just because she is a woman, even if it’s not all women, and including the “negative” aspects are two different problems

I want to get to a point where I don’t feel like I need someone else’s experience. Or rather the idea of someone’s experience.

I envy the other side of the dichotomy. I can't say that I "am" feminine. I just really want to be.

I mean sure there is some plausibility that I could cross dress and find a partner willing to swap gender roles. And I guess that would be okay and satisfying. Part of me feels like I have to transition. Part of me feels like it has nothing to do with being a man in a feminine role I want to be a woman.
